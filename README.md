# E-CAD

Tools for electrical engineering issues. This is a library, which is able
to recognize the structure elements from a string and split it according
the rules of the IEC/EN 81346 standard.


## ISO/IEC/EN 81346

The 81346 standard series has its roots in 1971 in the IEC 60113-2 standard
and has been updated at regular intervals ever since. Historically,
the IEC 81346-1 directly originates from the IEC 61346 standard series
and is merely a revision of the IEC 61346-1 part. 

The number of the publication changed in 2009 in order to facilitate a
common ISO/IEC standard series on reference designations. This resulted
in the worldwide recognized ISO/IEC 81346 RDS standard series as the
best standard for the designation of systems. 

### The Basic Rules & Principles

The ISO/IEC 81346-1 establishes the basic rules and general principles
of the overall 81346 standard. This is in regard to the structuring
of systems including the classification of systems. A fundamental premise
in ISO/IEC 81346-1 is that everything is about systems.

Based on the rules and principles, guidance is given regarding how to
formulate and thereby identify unambiguous reference designations of
objects in technical systems, or any system for that matter. 

The reference designation's primary purpose is to identify and retrieve
information about an object. Information that is reliable throughout
the full lifecycle of an object until it is deleted. 

### The Structuring

The basic principle of a reference designation system deals with structures.
In order for a system to be efficiently specified, designed, manufactured,
serviced or operated, the system and the information about the system are
normally divided into part-of relations.

Each of these parts can be further divided. This successive subdivision
into parts and the organization of those parts are called “structuring”. 

It is important how you create a system structure and even more important
that the structure is done through a common technique. The structuring
technique in ISO/IEC 81346-1 is done through part-of relations. 

### The Aspects

Short and to the point, 81346-1:2022 applies aspects (views) to sort out
and monitor the technical information of objects, which thereby becomes
very clear. 

The 81346-1 part defines four basic aspects that can be used within the
ISO/IEC 81346 standard series. Each aspect is represented by a prefix,
which will indicate what aspect is used in the RDS syntax (e.g. =BA1).
There is a fifth aspect, which is user-defined and represented by the “#”
prefix. 

By applying an aspect when structuring, one can only see the information
that is relevant for this aspect, and any other information must then be
obtained in another manner, e.g. in another aspect. 

The overall purpose is to create a clear technical view of the system
of interest in each aspect, and the aspects will therefore represent
different views of e.g., a production, power plant, oil platform,
wind-turbine, etc. This will enable one to navigate within even very
complex technical systems.
